- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zekarlos79
- ðŸ‘€ I specialize in Laboratory Medicine and Human Genetics and, for the past 10 years, I've been
      leading the Hematology Department in a medical lab serving nearly 2,000 patients daily.
- ðŸŒ± In 2022, I attended the "Artificial Intelligence and Data Science for Healthcare Professionals"
      course, which boosted my interest in using AI for medical analysis and diagnostic.
- ðŸ˜„ Since then, Iâ€™m looking to acquire knowledge and skills in AI.
- âœ¨ Now, I'm seeking new opportunities to learn and combine my professional expertise with AI and Data Science.
